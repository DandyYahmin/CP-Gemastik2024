## Lessons Learned

- Read the questions carefully, consider all possible scenarios, as the questions can be misleading.
- Input constraints can deceive AI.
- These questions are easier if you stay calm; it's recommended not to import other modules unless absolutely necessary.
- If your code experiences a `TIME LIMIT` issue and you're using `WHILE LOOP` or `FOR LOOP`, it's recommended to use recursive methods for iteration as they can speed up the compile time.


## FAQ

#### Question 1

Q: Why hasn't the [E] Fimoracci Sequence problem been solved yet?
