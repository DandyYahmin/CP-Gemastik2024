## Lessons Learned

- Read the questions carefully, consider all possible scenarios, as the questions can be misleading.
- Input constraints can deceive AI.
- These questions are easier if you stay calm; it's recommended not to import other modules unless absolutely necessary.
- If your code experiences a `TIME LIMIT` issue and you're using `WHILE LOOP` or `FOR LOOP`, it's recommended to use recursive methods for iteration as they can speed up the compile time.


## FAQ

#### Question 1

Q: Why hasn't the [E] Fimoracci Sequence problem been solved yet?

A: Because I haven't figured out the algorithm for it yet.

#### Question 2

Q: Have you tested it against other test cases?

A: I have only tested it according to the input and output provided in the   PDF module.

#### Question 3

Q: Does the compile time match what is stated in the PDF module?

A: I don't know; I don't have a tool to measure the compile time.
